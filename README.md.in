PoShWarp
========

PoShWarp is a PowerShell port of the [wd](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd)
plugin for zsh.  It aims to offer the same convenience that `wd` offers in zsh
alongside some idiomatic PowerShell commands.

Installation
------------

If you have [PsGet](http://psget.net/) installed, you can simply execute:

```PowerShell
Install-Module PoShWarp
```

Otherwise, for a manual installation:

1.  Create a `PoShWarp` directory in your modules folder.  You can determine
    where this is by looking at the `PSModulePath` environment variable.
2.  Download `PoShWarp.psm1` and place it in the newly created `PoShWarp`
    directory.
3.  PoShWarp should automatically load next time you start PowerShell.  If this
    does not happen, add `Import-Module PoShWarp` to your `$profile`.

Motivation
----------

Our systems contain projects strewn all over our systems.  We aim to keep things
organised but something will always disrupt our careful organisation, and it
becomes far to easy to forget where all these things end up living.  With
PoShWarp, this problem becomes far more manageable because these commonly-used
locations can be given names.  

Let's say we have a folder that contains a set of projects:

```
E:\Projects> Get-ChildItem


    Directory: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::E:\Projects


Mode           LastWriteTime       Length Name
----           -------------       ------ ----
d----    24/11/2014    17:11        <DIR> CunningEmbeddedProject
d----    24/11/2014    17:11        <DIR> SuperAwesomeProject
d----    24/11/2014    17:11        <DIR> TrendyWebProject
```

We can can create *warp-names* for two of these projects like so:

```
E:\Projects> cd .\SuperAwesomeProject\
E:\Projects\SuperAwesomeProject
E:\Projects\SuperAwesomeProject> New-WarpLocation awesome

Name                Path
----                ----
awesome             E:\Projects\SuperAwesomeProject


E:\Projects\SuperAwesomeProject> New-WarpLocation trendy ..\TrendyWebProject

Name                Path
----                ----
trendy              E:\Projects\TrendyWebProject
```

These two bindings now appear in a system-wide *warp-map* that exists in the
same directory as your `$profile` by default.  You can relocate the warp-map by
setting the `POSHWARP_MAPFILE` environment variable to point where you would
prefer it to be.  Now our sample warp-map looks like:

```
E:\> Get-WarpLocation

Name                Path
----                ----
awesome             E:\Projects\SuperAwesomeProject
trendy              E:\Projects\TrendyWebProject
```

Now we can enter into either project directory without needing to remember the
path:

```
C:\> Select-WarpLocation awesome
E:\Projects\SuperAwesomeProject> Select-WarpLocation trendy
E:\Projects\TrendyWebProject>
```

Granted, this example is rather simple but visiting directories frequently can
get annoying quite swiftly.  Especially if those paths are particularly deep or
if they contain confusing or similar sub-directories.  With PoShWarp, `cd`-ing
to that arcane directory can now be replaced with `Select-WarpLocation myplace`
or the far simpler `wd myplace`.


Commands
========

{% Select-WarpLocation %}
{% New-WarpLocation %}
{% Remove-WarpLocation %}
{% Get-WarpLocation %}
{% Repair-WarpMap %}
{% wd %}


<a id="warpmap"></a>
The Warp-map File
=================

All warp-locations created by [`New-WarpLocation`](#New-WarpLocation) are saved
in an XML file called the *warp-map*.  By default, this file is named
`WarpMap.xml` and will be created in the same directory as your `$profile`, but
it can be placed elsewhere using the `POSHWARP_MAPFILE` environment variable. 
The commands in the example given above would lead to the following warp-map:

```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<WarpMap>
  <Location Name="awesome" Path="E:\Projects\SuperAwesomeProject" />
  <Location Name="trendy" Path="E:\Projects\TrendyWebProject" />
</WarpMap>
```

The format is largely self-explanatory and has been kept deliberately simple. 
Warp-maps maybe be edited by hand and may include custom XML if you wish to use
the file for multiple purposes.  There is no guarantee that the additional
elements will be left undamaged, but PoShWarp commands have been designed to
modify only the elements that are necessary.  Of course, there is a risk that a
future version of PoShWarp may include additional XML that may conflict with any
custom elements that have been added.


Testing
=======

Every exported PoShWarp command includes a corresponding set of tests that can
be executed using [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester).  Running the 
`Invoke-Pester` command from the source directory will load `PoShWarp.Tests.ps1`
and create an environment for the tests to operate in.  This environment
includes a warp-map and a suitable directory structure which will be removed as
part of the tear-down.
